The ex-Reading defender denied fraudulent trading charges relating to the Sodje Sports Foundation - a charity to raise money for Nigerian sport.
Mr Sodje, 37, is jointly charged with elder brothers Efe, 44, Bright, 50 and Stephen, 42.
Appearing at the Old Bailey earlier, all four denied the offence.
The charge relates to offences which allegedly took place between 2008 and 2014.
Sam, from Kent, Efe and Bright, of Greater Manchester, and Stephen, from Bexley, are due to stand trial in July.
They were all released on bail.

Voges was forced to retire hurt on 86 after suffering the injury while batting during the County Championship draw with Somerset on 4 June.
Middlesex hope to have the Australian back for their T20 Blast game against Hampshire at Lord's on 3 August.
The 37-year-old has scored 230 runs in four first-class games this season at an average of 57.50.
""Losing Adam is naturally a blow as he contributes significantly to everything we do,"" director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
""His absence, however, does give opportunities to other players who are desperate to play in the first XI.
""In the past we have coped well without an overseas player and I expect us to do so now.""
Defending county champions Middlesex are sixth in the Division One table, having drawn all four of their matches this season.
Voges retired from international cricket in February with a Test batting average of 61.87 from 31 innings, second only to Australian great Sir Donald Bradman's career average of 99.94 from 52 Tests.

Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition.
In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.
The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.
The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012.
Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful.""
He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - ""to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society"".
Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, said: ""To be able to publish a photographic shoot with the Duchess of Cambridge has been one of my greatest ambitions for the magazine.""
The collaboration for the June edition had resulted in ""a true celebration of our centenary as well as a fitting tribute to a young woman whose interest in both photography and the countryside is well known"", she said.
Other royal portraits to have featured in the fashion magazine include Diana, Princess of Wales - who graced the cover four times - and Princess Anne.
The duchess is to visit the exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery on Wednesday, Kensington Palace said.

Chris Poole - known as ""moot"" online - created the site in 2003.
It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared.
It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site.
However, 4chan has also been the rallying point for many instances of online activism from the likes of Anonymous, the loosely organized hacktivism group.
Mr Poole shared news of his new position on blogging site Tumblr.
""When meeting with current and former Googlers, I continually find myself drawn to their intelligence, passion, and enthusiasm - as well as a universal desire to share it with others.""
""I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to enabling these same talented people to tackle some of the world's most interesting and important problems.
He added: ""I can't wait to contribute my own experience from a dozen years of building online communities, and to begin the next chapter of my career at such an incredible company.""
Mr Poole stepped down as the administrator of 4chan in January 2015. Now he is expected to turn his attentions to Google's social networking efforts.
His arrival was welcomed by Bradley Horowitz, the head of ""streams, photos and sharing"" at the search giant's floundering social network, Google+.
""I'm thrilled he's joining our team here at Google,"" Mr Horowitz said.
""Welcome Chris!ï»¿""
Several commentators described the appointment as ""unexpected"" but noted that Mr Poole's expertise with social media could prove useful to the search firm.

Barca will be investigated for alleged misappropriation of funds in the £48.6m (57m euros) deal with Santos.
The signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries
Rosell, speaking at a news conference after a Barca board meeting, insisted he had ""acted correctly"".
Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010.
Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee.
Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"".
He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family.
""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries.""
Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from ""unfair attacks"" that could ""negatively affect their management or the image of the club"".
He added: ""It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.""
Rosell was named Barca president in the summer of 2010 after winning a landslide vote to succeed Joan Laporta, earning 61.34% of a record turn-out of 57,088 voters.
He had also been vice-president under Laporta before resigning in 2005.

The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000.
The government said London was the highest funded part of the country.
It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average.
But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance.
Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200.
It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.
In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country.""
It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree.""

Burns and Roy put on a 118-run fourth wicket stand as Surrey closed on 384-8.
Roy's century was a fine retort against Division One leaders Middlesex, who dismissed the England limited-overs opener for a first-ball duck in the One-Day Cup on Tuesday.
After paceman Murtagh removed both Zafar Ansari and Dominic Sibley early on, Surrey's slump continued as James Franklin trapped Aaron Finch (37) to leave them 70-3.
Burns helped turn their fortunes around as he hit 15 fours in his 127-ball knock as the visitors seized the initiative.

Ms Kendall told the BBC Labour risked sending a ""resignation letter to the British people as a serious party of government"" by electing Mr Corbyn.
Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader.
It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters.
The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.
More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest but Labour has said applications are still being verified.

Of which, full party members:  299,755
Affiliated to a trade union:  189,703
Registered to vote by paying Â£3:  121,295
Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday.
Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later.
The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party.
Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"".
""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added.
But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences.
He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'""
In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn.
""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences.
""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest.""
The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party.
However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake.""
Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences.
""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that.""
Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy.
His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament.
In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"".
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"".
Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"".
The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to ""find a role"" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has ""lit up the election campaign"".

The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020.
The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead.
Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham.
She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue.
It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years.
Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets.
ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much.
The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget.
Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools.
One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"".
Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support.
More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education.
And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips.
Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects.
Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level.
Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!""
One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity.
Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need.
""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people.""
A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""

Ann Barnes dealt with an ""ill-advised"" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role.
But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
""Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time,"" she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: ""You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it.""
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
""[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service,"" she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: ""You can't interview for the unexpected.""
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's ""open and transparent"" culture.
And she said a new victim centre was providing ""a wraparound service"" to victims and witnesses, and she believed it would become a blueprint for delivering victims' services.
Voting for Kent's next PCC will take place on 5 May, with six candidates standing.

On Saturday Newport host fourth-placed Northampton Town hoping to win their third game in a row for the first time since last December, 2014.
The Exiles are also seeking their first home win since March.
Taylor's move means County are currently without a second goalkeeper.
Sheridan added: ""Rhys' move to Wrexham happened quickly... but we'll definitely have a keeper by the middle of next week.
""It's only one game. I'm not really worried.""
Sheridan also confirmed that defender Janoi Donacien has extended his loan spell from Aston Villa until January.
Donacien has featured in all four games since the Irishman replaced Terry Butcher as manager at the beginning of October.
Meanwhile Newport have no injury concerns ahead of Saturday's game.

The Derbyshire club, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One North, have lost all 19 league and cup games this season.
New Mills have conceded 68 goals while three managers have left since June.
""It's tough but we've got a new squad and the players are starting to gel,"" Millers boss Garry Brown told BBC Radio 5 live's Non League Football Show.
Former Norwich City midfielder Keith Briggs took over from Roy Soule, who stepped down in June, but resigned after just 23 days for a job with Sheffield United's academy.
Andy Fearn was put in charge in July and appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant.
But Fearn and Goater lasted just nine league and cup games before resigning after a 7-1 home defeat to Prescot Cables.
Brown, who has overseen 10 league and cup defeats, added: ""There's been a lot of changes to the squad and there's only three players still here from when we took over in September.
""There's no budget, it's petrol money these lads are playing for.""
All is not lost for the Millers, who are bottom of the table, 10 points behind Harrogate Railway Athletic, the next team above them.
Brown, along with Paul Williams (his assistant at New Mills) and Lee Gregory, last season led Manchester team Wythenshawe Town to an astonishing 39 wins from 39 games played.
Bashley, who play in the Southern League Division One South & West, are also without a point after losing all 14 league games this season.
But they did manage a win in the FA Trophy preliminary round.

The referendum will take place on 10 March, but Bath Conservative MP Ben Howlett said he was concerned about a ""lack of awareness"" about the issue.
Mr Howlett also said he is worried about the public's level of engagement.
Bath and North East Somerset Council said the referendum had been publicised in press releases and tweets.
It also said it was the subject of a two-page article in the winter edition of the council magazine which was distributed to all households in the region.
A further news release and polling cards will also be sent out to all households this week, the authority added.
Supporters of the referendum say Bath needs a mayor to give local government more visibility.
Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum.
Mr Howlett said he was ""personally concerned"" that an elected mayor was not appropriate for an area ""as diverse"" as Bath and North East Somerset, and that it could ""lead to an increase in the cost of local politics"".
""The level of misinformation on this issue is worrying - many people seem to still believe this is about a mayor of Bath and not understanding it would cover all of Bath and North East Somerset.
""I hope in the coming weeks more information will be forthcoming to enable residents to make an informed decision,"" he added.

More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital on Sunday evening, the cafe said, shouting and throwing meat at patrons.
A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived.
Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested.
The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis.
The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi.
They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute.
The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings.
Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West.
The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook.
It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"".
It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents.
The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia.
Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest.
The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"".
These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said.
Some minor injuries were sustained.
The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, ""yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened"".

The New Zealander made only one unenforced switch, bringing in Rhys Webb for Gareth Davies at scrum-half.
Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Alex Cuthbert miss out with injuries.
""We wanted to give the players a chance to sort of put behind us a disappointing first half from last week,"" said Gatland.
Flanker Justin Tipuric, second row Luke Charteris and Hallam Amos are drafted in to the team in place of the injured players.
Dan Lydiate will captain the side in the absence of Warburton and regular stand-in Jones.
Gatland said he had shown faith in players who had performed well in earlier matches, a fact he acknowledged was hard on hooker Ken Owens who makes his fourth appearance on the bench in this Six Nations championship.
""He's unlucky, really unlucky,"" he added.
""We felt that [hooker] Scott Baldwin has gone pretty well throughout the campaign.
""Ken has been brilliant for us coming off the bench and I know that's a tag he doesn't want to keep, but he is unlucky not to get a start.""
Scarlets hooker Owens had made 38 appearances for Wales, but started in only eight of those games.
Wales go into the match against Italy knowing a win will secure second place in the championship for the first time since it was expended to include six countries.
Lydiate will lead Wales for the first time in a Test match, having previously led them in a midweek match against EP Kings on the summer tour of South Africa in 2014.
He said it was a ""personal honour for me and my family"" and added his captaincy style was unsophisticated.
""I wouldn't ask someone to do something that I wouldn't do myself, so I'll throw myself in front of a bus so that's what I expect everyone else to do,"" he said.
""There are plenty of leaders and a wealth of experience in the team.""

Then playing for Walsall, the 24-year-old won his first senior cap for Wales in their defeat by Ukraine in March, giving him the chance to rub shoulders with the duo.
Injury dashed his hopes of joining them at Euro 2016, however.
""They constantly want to improve and get better so that's something every footballer should apply to their game,"" Bradshaw told BBC Radio Wales.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years.
Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors.
""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said.
""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team.""
Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.
The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley.
""It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did,"" he said.
""I was incredibly proud of the boys and how impressive they were at the Euros. I was gutted, but that's football. Unfortunately that was part and parcel of the game.
""But I picked my head up and managed to get a move to the Championship and I'm just trying to improve. It hurt for a while. It took for the majority of that summer for me to get over it.
""I was watching all the games and cheering the lads on from afar, but it was invaluable experience for me to go away to Portugal although I didn't manage to train that much because of the injury, it's all experience that I've enjoyed and hopefully I can put it into good use in the future and hopefully one day I'll get an opportunity again.""

The trailer concludes with a shot of Vader and the sound of his trademark heavy breathing.
Felicity Jones stars in Gareth Edwards' film as the leader of a Rebel mission to steal the plans for the Death Star.
The film is set before the time of the first Star Wars film A New Hope, released in 1977, and does not form part of the main series.
The two-minute promo, which is different from the one shown at last month's Star Wars Celebration event in London, begins with new character Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) telling Jyn Erso (Jones) that ""the world is coming undone"".
""Imperial flags reign across the galaxy,"" his voice continues over a shot of an Empire vessel floating above a desert landscape.
The trailer goes on to show Jyn and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) being told about the mission for which they have been selected.
Subsequent scenes feature a new robot character voiced by Alan Tudyk, a blind warrior played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, and an Imperial Walker being struck by a missile.
Actress Alyssa Milano, screenwriter Max Landis and DJ Edith Bowman are among those to welcome the new promo on Twitter.
US publication Entertainment Weekly, meanwhile, has assembled a frame-by-frame analysis.
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released in the UK on 16 December.

John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences.
At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a ""sexual fiend"" who targeted vulnerable females.
MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls.
The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women.
In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust.
""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did.""
The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend.""
Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison.
He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison.""
Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence.
Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.
He said: ""During the investigation there was also significant involvement from the local authority in terms of housing and social work support for not only the victims but also their children.
""However, the most important people in all this are the victims and I must pay tribute to them in both coming forward to the police and staying with the prosecution process to conviction.
""I hope that this result will bring some comfort to the victims in this case and give confidence to anyone who has suffered similar experiences to come forward in the knowledge that their case will be sensitively and thoroughly investigated.""

A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire.
Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack.
A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack.
Islamic State militants also operate in the area.
Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan.
The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand.
It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May.
Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province.
In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched.
It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police.
Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike.
In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure.
The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.
Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.
Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.

The tourists were attacked when they were on their way to a temple in the holy town of Pushkar on Monday evening.
The woman said her clothes were torn off and her companion was beaten up when he protested and tried to stop the men from attacking her.
Pushkar is a popular destination among foreign tourists. The town hosts an annual camel fair.
The men who attacked the couple ""were consuming liquor"", Indian media reports quoted superintendent of police Nitindeep Balaggan as saying.
""The goons attempted to molest a woman tourist and tore her clothes off. They inflicted serious injuries upon her male friend when he tried to intervene,"" Mr Balaggan told the Hindustan Times.
Indian media reports said the woman was Spanish. The nationality of her companion was not yet clear.
Increasing numbers of rapes and attacks are being reported and highlighted in India, prompting widespread outrage.
Last year, five men were arrested in Kolkata (Calcutta) and charged with kidnapping and repeatedly raping a Japanese student.
In June 2013, a 30-year-old American woman was gang-raped in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh.

Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact.
Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced.
Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets.
More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China.
""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products.
Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only,
Cathay said it would continue to review its policy.
Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"".
""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP.
Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.
During this period there was also a significant decline in imports by air.
Cathay now joins airlines including British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates in banning shark fin.

The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project.
The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering.
The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle.
The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link.
""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark.
Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations.
These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts.
Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests.
The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.
Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.

Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.
But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.
Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.
You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.
Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.
That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.
The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.
So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.
Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.
The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.
Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.
Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.
It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.
Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?
Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.
Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.
It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.
The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.
Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.

The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with ""the bends"", was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.
The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"".
Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"".
""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said.
""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.""
In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system.
Source: NHS
Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year.
He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"".
In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said.
Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC.
It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.

Rajesh Shah, one of the shop's co-owners, told the BBC there would be a new name ""tomorrow or the day after"".
Jews in the city of Ahmedabad, where the shop opened last month, said using the Nazi dictator's name was offensive. Israeli diplomats also raised the issue with the Gujarat state government.
The owners said they did not know who Adolf Hitler was when the shop opened.
Mr Shah told the BBC: ""Yes we are planning to change the name. There has been too much political pressure from the government.""
He said officials had promised compensation for the rebranding of the store, which sells men's clothing, although he said they had provided nothing in writing.
His co-owner, Manish Chandani, told AFP news agency they had never intended to glorify Hitler.
""I was not aware of Hitler being responsible for the killings of six million people before the shop's inauguration. This time I will choose a non-controversial name.""
Mr Chandani says the shop's name was a tribute to his grandfather who was nicknamed Hitler because he was ""very strict"".
Others saw the name as a marketing gimmick in a country where the former German leader attracts unusual interest in some sections of society.
""I am happy that the store owner decided to change the name. I guess he realised that it was not the right thing to do,"" Orna Sagiv, Israeli consul general in Mumbai, told AFP.

IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.

Energy Minister Fergus Ewing refused permission for the 21-turbine Rowantree development near Oxton last May.
He said the decision was based on ""unacceptable environmental impacts"".
RWE Innogy UK has submitted scoping plans to Scottish Borders Council for a wind farm of up to 11 turbines in the same location.
The proposed development on land north-east and east of Burnhouse Mains farmhouse, between Stow and Fountainhall, will be known as Longmuir Rigg wind farm.
A letter lodged with the council states that RWE's new plans for the site take into account the Scottish government's concerns about the Rowantree development.
In the correspondence, project manager Christopher McPake states: ""It has sought to reduce or negate the identified significant environmental effects of cumulative noise as well as effects upon landscape character and visual receptors.""
It lays out plans to build between nine and 11 turbines, no more than 130m (426ft) high.

The independent mayor said: ""You have two people here who claim the sale of Acklam Hall was dodgy.
""What those people have got to do now is produce the evidence of malpractice, corruption, or criminality and I will give you a cast iron guarantee they will not be able to produce one shred of evidence.
""Now they've actually got to put up or shut up.""
Mr Junier (Independent), who has asked the Secretary of State to investigate the sale of the land, said: ""This was all about me having a duty to ask questions and raise concerns wherever they exist.
""All I want to know is did the taxpayers get the best deal possible for that land?""
The hall was valued at about Â£1m some years ago but Middlesbrough Council has refused to say how much it was sold for.
Critics said the 32 acres of land was worth more more than Â£20m.
Ms Bell told the BBC she had raised a matter of concern which had not yet been resolved and now awaits the outcome with interest.

The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.
The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%.
However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%.
The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%.
""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes.
Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June.
Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter.
Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter.
Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year.
The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.

Chris Norton, who is uploading the photos to Twitter account @UrineWatch, said he noticed men repeatedly using the wall at his premises as a toilet.
The businessman, based in Bradford Street, Walsall, said he was shocked to find it happening up to five times every day.
Walsall Council is investigating.
More on this story and others from Birmingham and the Black Country
Mr Norton, who uses the hashtag #walsallwee, said: ""It's been happening for more than two months and I reported it to the council but nothing happened.
""So I decided I had to take action myself because it was getting very depressing to see.
""I thought it was just happening at weekends, but when I saw the footage it was actually happening up to five times a day.""
Deputy council leader Adrian Andrew said the authority is looking to establish a public space protection order in the town centre to combat anti-social behaviour.
""Officers are gathering information, which includes Mr Norton's evidence, and talking to other businesses in the area and the police to determine our next course of action,"" he said.
""Both myself and the majority of residents in Walsall are proud of this town. We've worked damn hard to attract investment here and I'm not going to allow the behaviour of a few to cause such a stink.""

Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales.
There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces.
Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"".
The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act.
PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014.
The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from.
Just over three-quarters of forces replied.
Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved.
The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27.
Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy.
Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire.
Only four incidents involved children under 11.
An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.
There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds.
In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330.
Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary.
The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases.
There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands.
South Wales police reported 92 cases.
There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents.
Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets.
""Teachers and school leaders are always alert to the potential for young people being involved in drug or alcohol abuse.""
Ms Keates said many specialist programmes to help schools support and educate young people about substance abuse had been cut in recent years.

Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police.
The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"".
The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years.
They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.
The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings.
After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year.
The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.
More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.
Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.
The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.
In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.
Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.
Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.
Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.
His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.
Police said their actions ""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands.
Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.
The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.
But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.
""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said.
""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.
""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.
""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.""
From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.
She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.
Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.
Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.
""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.""
Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.
Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.
But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.
The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.
Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.
That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.
But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.
Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.

Gary Haggarty, 44, is no longer to be prosecuted for three alleged offences.
His lawyers said these relate to possessing explosives and firearms.
His legal team are also set to challenge the ""propriety"" of prosecuting a man they say worked as a state agent for some of the remaining 209 counts against him.
On Wednesday, Belfast Magistrates' Court was told that a hearing to decide if the suspected UVF commander-turned police informer has a case to answer is scheduled for November.
Mr Haggarty has been waiting to discover if he will stand trial since signing an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010.
The north Belfast man was charged with 212 charges covering a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007.
The prosecution case against him runs to 12,000 pages, with his alleged offences including:
Mr Haggarty, whose address is listed as c/o the Police Service of Northern Ireland, is believed to be living at a secret location in England.
He was not present for the latest stage in an ongoing court review of the case.
Outside court, Mr Haggarty's solicitor said a challenge would be mounted against some of the remaining charges.
""The defence forwarded written submissions to the PPS on 4 May dealing firstly with charges where we say the papers do not disclose a prima facie case, but also charges where there are issues in relation to the propriety of the charges at a time when the defendant was a state agent from 1993-2004,"" he said.

Mr Gargan, 48, was found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but has been allowed to return to work.
The Avon and Somerset branch of the federation said it ""cannot envisage"" how the public or police can have ""confidence in his leadership"".
Mr Gargan said he understood people had questions and said he would address these.
In a statement issued through the Chief Police Officers Staff Association, he said he was ""very much looking forward to returning to work"" and ""beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force"".
The comments about his return to work were made in an open letter to Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens.
Mr Gargan was suspended following allegations of data protection breaches and inappropriate behaviour with women.
A panel found him guilty of misconduct - but cleared him of gross misconduct. His suspension was lifted and a phased return to work prepared.
Mr Gargan said his actions had ""fallen below the standards expected of a chief constable"".
In the letter seen by the BBC, the Police Federation said the chief constable is ""the person that sets the standard of professional behaviour and ethical conduct"" and the role ""must be beyond reproach"" in the eyes of the public and police officers.
It said its officers had been asked on a daily basis by ""the communities they serve"" how the chief constable ""can return to work in these circumstances"".
The letter ends with the federation calling on the commissioner to ""show strong leadership in dealing with this issue"".
Some former members of the force have also criticised Mr Gargan's return.
One group of retired officers said the ""debacle"" had caused ""more pain and damage to morale than is imaginable"".
Lawrie Lewis, a retired Chief Superintendent, said the force's reputation had been ""severely tarnished"".
Sue Mountstevens said: ""The procedure to be followed in relation to the sanction hearing is strictly regulated.
""As with all judicial processes when proceedings are not complete it is not possible to discuss or comment upon them until they have been finalised.""

Michael Bryn Jones, 39, from Llandudno, disappeared on 3 April 2016 after going to the door of the Hergest psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor.
He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures.
An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital.
He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone.
Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment.
""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said.
""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask.
""I should have asked if he'd been having treatment.  It has been something I've thought about a lot since.""
Dr Stuart Porter, a consultant psychiatrist who reviewed the incident, said: ""Somebody should have taken Michael Bryn Jones to accident and emergency.  It's also good practice to follow that up with a phone call.""
In a statement, BCUHB said it offered ""sincere condolences"" to Mr Jones' family and ""fully accepted"" the coroner's findings.
""We have carried out our own thorough investigation, in conjunction with Michael's family, and as a result we have made changes to service provision,"" it added.
Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Nicola Jones said: ""There should have been more effort to persuade [Mr Jones] to come into the Hergest unit for a full assessment of his condition.
""He went to that unit looking for help, and he didn't get it.""

Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices.
Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday.
But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas.
The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist.
Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p.
The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps.
The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier.
Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks.
Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury's on Saturday.
Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country.
He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.
""We would urge motorists to look around to find a better price. There are petrol price apps that can help,"" he said.

More than 5,500 people signed a petition against plans to build a five-metre embankment along the waterfront.
However, the council has admitted that there will never be a consensus on any flood protection proposal.
A report to a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council's environment committee next week will attempt to find a way forward.
What's happening in Scotland? Keep in touch through our live page.
Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that.
""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme.""
Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises.
Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.
They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces.
David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage.
""It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.""
Earlier this year MSPs called for the row over the flood protection plans to be brought to a ""positive conclusion"".

The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m.
Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank.
They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures.
The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015.
Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital.
No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000.
Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m.
And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m.
""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank.
""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.""
However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m.
In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall.
One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014.
The buyer of a £1m house will now pay £43,750 in Stamp Duty, up from £40,000 previously.

Mr Salar, who has not commented, started working for Mr Khan in 2014.
In light of the posts, cabinet minister Chris Grayling questioned Mr Khan's judgement in employing Mr Salar.
""'These comments have absolutely no place in modern society,"" the leader of the House of Commons said.
""The mayor of London makes a large number of decisions about who to hire and how to spend public funds: his record shows Sadiq Khan can't make those decisions in a way that stands up for Londoners.""
Mr Khan is tipped by the bookies to become London's next mayor on 5 May, beating his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith.
A spokesman said: ""Clearly these are serious issues. Shueb Salar has been suspended from Sadiq Khan's parliamentary office pending an investigation.""

The hoard, which includes silver pennies dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries, was discovered by Walter Hanks in Llandwrog in March.
National Museum Wales said some of the coins were made under the ruler Sihtric Anlafsson and were a type rarely found on the British mainland.
It said they were likely to have been hidden or lost between 1020 and 1030.
Dr Mark Redknap, of the department of history and archaeology at National Museum Wales, said the mixed nature of the collection showed bullion played an active role in the 11th Century economy and gave an idea of the wealth of Gwynedd at the time.

Eren Hasyer had denied attempting to aid the escape of Izzet Eren as he was being driven to Wood Green Crown Court in a custody van.
Accomplice Jermaine Baker was shot dead by police during the escape attempt in December 2015.
Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court cleared Hasyer, 25, of a firearms charge.
Izzet Eren was being held on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs accused of gun offences when he arranged for a gang to spring him from the van en-route to a hearing, Woolwich Crown Court was earlier told.
Jurors heard the prisoner hatched the escape plot from his cell using a smuggled mobile phone and the attempted breakout took place on 11 December, in what the prosecutor described as a carefully thought out and professional crime.
Ozcan Eren, 31, changed his plea and admitted his part in the plot after the trial opened.
Two other men, Nathan Mason and Gokay Sogucakli, admitted being part of the escape plot before the trial began.
A separate investigation into the death of Jermaine Baker is ongoing.
Det Ch Supt Tom Manson Met Police said: ""This was a bold, well planned and carefully thought out conspiracy that bears all the hallmarks of a professional crime.
""They put in place anti-surveillance techniques; their own surveillance 'unit' and a command structure to run the operation.""

They describe it as a kind of ""jet stream"" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia.
The moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites.
This trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth's magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings.
The scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere.
""This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,"" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space).
“That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth's surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that's probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News.
Dr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Most people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly.
Dr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet.
They assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet.
Its behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add.
“It's likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,"" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper.
In the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet.
The scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core.
They call this boundary the ""tangent cylinder"". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis.
When liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.
""Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,"" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.
""This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.""
Although the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.
Dr Livermore told BBC News: ""It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).""
That the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.
Launched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field.
With their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.
It is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.
Scientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.
This occurs every few hundred thousand years.

The Dons turned down an undisclosed bid for the 29-year-old, who has made 22 appearances this season, on Friday.
""It's one of those things. You put a value on a player and that's what happens,"" Warnock told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
""We are just weighing up two or three other players at the moment to see what we're going to do.""
He continued: ""We try to keep away from the last-minute deadline but I'm afraid it's always there. There's a possibility that we might make another offer.""
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes says he has told Cardiff to ""be serious"" with regard to the fee if they wish to pursue their interest in Hayes.
Meanwhile, Warnock revealed he was in talks to bring a Premier League goalkeeper to the Cardiff City Stadium, and said he would not have sanctioned former keeper David Marshall's move to Hull City last summer.
""If I had been here all season I would have desperately gone out of my way to make sure he didn't leave,"" he added.
""We lost two goalkeepers on the last day [of the transfer window] and didn't recruit anybody, which has really snookered me really.
""I've been looking to get a permanent goalkeeper in now, I've made two offers for players which have both been turned town and now I'm trying to get somebody on loan from the Premier League.""

Scotland's National Action Plan for Human Rights has been developed after four years of research by the Scottish Human Rights Commission.
The plan aims to improve human rights protection in Scotland.
The commission's evidence suggests basic rights are not consistently promoted, respected or protected in people's every day lives.
The Scottish government, the NHS, Amnesty International and various other organisations including trade unions and local authorities were involved in creating the action plan.
Areas of concern when drawing up the document included: care, disability rights, health, criminal justice and business.
Commitments have been made by the bodies behind the plan to integrate human rights more closely into their work.
Commission chair Professor Alan Miller said: ""Today, International Human Rights Day, Scotland is taking a big step towards building a country where everyone can live a life of human dignity.
""The Scottish Parliament has human rights at its heart, it created the Scottish Human Rights Commission and today Scotland's first National Action Plan for Human Rights is launched as the next step on Scotland's journey to progressively realise internationally agreed human rights for the benefit of everyone.""
Although this is the first human rights action plan in the UK, they do exist in other countries, such as Sweden, Spain, New Zealand and Australia.
Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights said: ""Scotland's National Action Plan for Human Rights is a bold venture which aims to bring human rights home in people's everyday life.
""It signals a strong commitment to internationally agreed human rights standards which is particularly significant in the current context of economic crisis and austerity.""
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The plan is an important milestone in our journey to create a Scotland which acts as a beacon of progress internationally.
""We will continue to work with the Scottish Human Rights Commission to make rights a reality for all in Scotland, in keeping with the importance this Government has long attached to human dignity, equality and fairness and the pursuit of social justice.""

Tevez, 31, started his career at Boca before leaving in 2004 and returns to Argentina after nine years in Europe.
Former Manchester United, Manchester City and West Ham forward Tevez struck 20 Serie A goals last season and had been linked with Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Paris St-Germain.
Juventus had already replaced Tevez with Mario Mandzukic from Atletico.
Boca Juniors confirmed the transfer while Tevez was on the bench for the Copa America quarter-final against Colombia.
Shortly after the announcement was made, Tevez came on to score the winning penalty in a shootout to send Argentina into the last four.
Boca president Daniel Angelici said: ""It is a day of joy and great satisfaction. The return of Carlos Tevez in an extraordinary moment of his career is fantastic news for all partners and supporters of Boca and Argentine football. The presence of Carlos will give another leap in quality to the great squad we have.""
Tevez, who has won three league titles in England and two in Italy, scored 38 goals in 110 games during his first spell at Boca, where he won the league in 2003 and was voted South American Player of the Year for three straight seasons.
He left for Brazilian side Corinthians before the 2005 season, and moved to West Ham the following year.

A day before turning 43, the oldest rider in the event beat Russian Olga Zabelinskaya, who returned from a doping ban last year, by 5.55 seconds.
Dutch rider Anna van der Breggen, winner of the road race, took bronze.
Great Britain's Emma Pooley, who, like Armstrong, came out of retirement to compete in Rio, finished 14th.
Find out how to get into cycling with our special guide.
Pooley, 33, told BBC Radio 5 live she ""struggled with the blustery crosswind"" on the hilly 29,7km course.
""The weather was a bit different to what we expected,"" she said. ""I had to ditch my visor halfway round because it got steamed up.
""Some people are just better at cornering in the wet, I guess.""
Armstrong became the first person to win the same road cycling event at three Olympics.
Having won the time trial at Beijing 2008, she retired in 2009 to start a family before returning to win gold at London 2012 and retiring again.

Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?
Maybe. Maybe not.
But there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.
Here are five.
Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.
""By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,"" he posted on Facebook back in September. ""I am only working for the people of the US!""
Even though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.
Now, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (Â£307,850) per person.
Mr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.
Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.
""I don't have pollsters,"" he said last August. ""I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.""
In fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.
""Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,"" he told the Associated Press.
That was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.
Accurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.
At least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.
Like many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.
""I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,"" he said in October. ""Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.""
Part of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.
""I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,"" he said in January. ""In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.""
Then Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.
His campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.
This, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents ""the natural maturation of the campaign"".
Over the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.
""They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'"" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. ""And they let us down.""
Now Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and ""planted seeds"" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
On Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.
In the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.
On Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.
While one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.
It looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.
All of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.
While no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.
That may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.

The girl suffered injuries to her head, arm and leg in the incident in July 2014, Plymouth Crown Court heard.
Christopher Budd, 20, of Trelawney Gardens, Liskeard, Cornwall, and Ryan Swaddling, 23, from Cleeve Drive, Ivybridge, Devon, both deny dangerous driving.
About 200 people attended the event.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ""I thought I was going to die. You could hear screaming. I felt my head and I had a massive bump on it.""
She added: ""You could hear bodies bang against the car.""
Another teenager told the court a car drove over her leg at the meet.
The 17 injured, aged between 12 and 20, were among a crowd watching cars at the B&Q car park in Tavistock Road on 26 July.
One witness told the court: ""I fell to the floor and the car went over my leg. I don't remember how I hit my head. I remember everyone looking at me and blood pouring from my head.""
Another witness said the vehicles were seeing how fast they could get to a speed bump and trying to create smoke from their tyres.
He added there was one girl on the floor and there was ""blood everywhere"" after the crash.
The trial continues.

Their quartet of Marcus Hellner, Lars Nelson, Johan Olsson and Daniel Richardson led from start to finish and completed the course in one hour 28 minutes 42 seconds.
The battle for silver and bronze was won by Russia - who were watched by President Vladimir Putin.
The bronze was taken by France - their first medal in the event.
A day after their women's team came from behind to earn a narrow relay victory, Sweden's anchor Hellner skied alone for the entire fourth leg and grabbed a Swedish flag to wave as he entered the stadium and proceeded unchallenged down the final straight.
Hellner started the final leg with a 14-second lead over Russia's Maxim Vylegzhanin and quickly extended the gap, eventually winning by 27.3 seconds.
It was another disappointing day for Norway, who had fallen a minute behind by the second exchange and ended up fourth, a day after their heavily favoured women also failed to get a medal.

At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.
Though these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.
Two months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.
The proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's ""negativities"".
So would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.
Of 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.
And no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.
Food for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.
Here's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.
It was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.
Here's how and when he has scored them.
Rooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.
If he can keep that up then who knows...
... try, try again?
Well doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.
Harry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.
He's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.
""Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.""
Judging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.
It was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?
On the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.
A concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).
However, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.
The run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.
Possession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.
The Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.
It was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.
Clearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.
Javier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.
The former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.
In fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.
Hernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.
Against Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.
The fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.
Life just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.
The Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.
It means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.
But perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.

<article>
Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.
Scotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0.
Even so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache.
England needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily.
Damage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle.
Scotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea.
The rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors.
The occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands.
""You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,"" he later recalled.
It was a measure of Scotland's first-half performance that England used the interval to change their line-up. The game was still tied at 0-0, which suited Brown's side because the longer the game remained in the balance, the more doubt would enter the minds of the England players.
Venables was too wily to be outfoxed, though. Recognising that his side was not dominating possession enough to threaten, he brought on midfielder Jamie Redknapp at half-time. Eight minutes into the second half, Redknapp was involved in the move that resulted in Gary Neville crossing for Shearer to open the scoring with a header.
Scotland were not subdued by the goal, and Gordon Durie's header forced David Seaman to desperately claw the ball away.
Durie was involved in the next key moment, when he reached Stuart McCall's cross ahead of Tony Adams and was knocked over by the Arsenal defender's sliding challenge.
McAllister placed the ball on the spot, but as he ran to take his penalty kick, the ball rolled slightly. It was enough of a movement for Seaman to notice it and briefly wonder if the Scotland midfielder would stop and restart his run.
Instead, he struck the ball firmly but relatively straight, and Seaman blocked the spot-kick. McAllister later insisted that the movement of the ball was not an excuse for missing, but also insisted that if he had scored, he was convinced Scotland's momentum would have driven them to victory.
Instead, there was only further pain. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.
""You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill,"" Hendry later recalled.
Gascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.
The England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.
The night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.
Even with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.
Some of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.
They went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.
England reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland.

The project, called Historical Dances in an Antique Setting, is the work of Argentine artist Pablo Bronstein.
Three classically-trained dancers will be seen weaving up and down the Duveen Galleries ""striking elegant and refined poses"".
The free installation opens on Tuesday with live performances from 1100-1700. It runs until 9 October.
Bronstein's work also features two large-scale architectural structures which are overlaid with images of Tate Britain's exterior architecture.
The effect is described as ""visually turning the gallery inside out"".
""Grand architecture is one of the things I'm most interested in, so it was a rare opportunity to be able to create work in such a unique setting as the Duveen Galleries,"" Bronstein said.
""The commission also presented a perfect and challenging opportunity to work with performance on a large scale.""
Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said: ""Pablo Bronstein's work consistently makes for deliciously jarring encounters between past and present, and between art and society. It's fantastic to see his work come to life in the aesthetic and institutional grandeur of Tate Britain's Duveen Galleries.""

A application has been submitted to extend the Advanced Manufacturing and Research Centre Campus (AMRC) on the site of the old Sheffield Airport.
The centre is already home to a number of high technology companies, including a £110m Rolls Royce jet engine factory.
If approved, the new site would be developed over the next 10 years.
Located on the Rotherham and Sheffield border, the site closed to commercial flying in 2008, although it is still the base for South Yorkshire Police's helicopter.
The business park, which is home to a training centre and a nuclear research facility, opened in 2012.
A new £43m ""flexible factory"" is being built in a partnership between the University of Sheffield and companies including Boeing.
As well as new research facilities, offices and workspaces would be also be built.
James Newman, chairman of the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, said he hoped the expansion would encourage more businesses to invest in the area.
""They will be right in the nerve centre of advanced manufacturing,"" he said.
""All around them will be people doing top research in nuclear, in aerospace and in other high-tech industries.""
""If we can bring high-tech jobs then that's what we want.""

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was 14.
A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College.
The meeting was arranged on Snapchat.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her.
""He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,"" Ms Robertson said.
""He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area.
""They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave.""
The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day.
She then told a counsellor who called in police.
The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence.
The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term.
She said: ""He's aware he faces more time in custody.
""The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option.
""This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage.""
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers.
He said: ""Unfortunately from your perspective no other method than custody is appropriate.
""I've come to that decision based on the gravity of the offence and also because you were subject to a CPO with specialist elements which you don't appear to have learned from.""

<article>
One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year.
The other was the Economist. The magazine, that is.
Their bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff.
The country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade.
The more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018.
""China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,"" says Prof Pettis.
""In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.""
Other examples include the Brazilian economic ""miracle"" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a ""lost decade"" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation.
What these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training.
""You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,"" he explains. ""And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable.
""But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.""
China has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years.
""A lot of growth is fake,"" he says. ""If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport.
""If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.""
He says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries.
The third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services.
But here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy.
If investment just stagnates - and in developed capitalist economies it usually falls after such a long boom - then, with consumer spending starting from such a low base, China would have to pull off the biggest consumer spending boom in history just to maintain overall economic growth at the planned rate of 7%-8%.
But the kinds of policies that would be needed to pull this off - such as paying Chinese households more interest on their savings, paying Chinese workers higher wages at the cost of state-owned company profits, or providing Chinese migrant workers with decent social benefits - run up against powerful politically-connected interests.
Prof Pettis is doubtful that it can be done.
""The bet's still on,"" says Simon Cox, Asia economics editor at the Economist. ""Though it won't be resolved till the end of the decade.""
The Economist's side of the bet - that China will overtake the US by 2018 - was the default scenario in an interactive forecaster that they stuck on their website to let readers play God with the Chinese economy.
""[2018] seems quite soon, but then you look at the individual assumptions, and they don't seem too whacky.""
One crucial assumption is the exchange rate. Mr Cox's team expects the yuan to strengthen against the dollar, even while prices rise more quickly in China, meaning that measured in dollars China's economy could still grow very rapidly, even if in reality the country actually slows down.
""I agree with Pettis on a whole range of things. I think the investment rate is too high, and it is difficult to invest wisely when you are doing it so fast. A lot of investment, especially by state-owned companies, is inefficient.""
Where he parts company with the Beijing-based professor is on the question of whether China is running out of decent investment opportunities.
China is still a very underdeveloped country, and he says the capital stock per worker - the quantity of buildings, machinery, infrastructure, vehicles and suchlike relative to the population size - is still very low by Western or Japanese standards.
He also says that while Prof Pettis is focused on where spending will come from, what really matters for long-term growth is China's ability to improve skills and adopt new technology.
Will China fall flat on its face?
China's economic miracle
China businessmen's stories
""China is very good at absorbing knowhow from the rest of the world. It is much more open to foreign investment than Korea and Japan were. And it has a large domestic market, so foreign producers have an incentive to tutor local suppliers in their products.""
Mr Cox confesses to being an old-school Keynesian. As such, he believes that even if - as Prof Pettis believes - China does run into the same problem as the West, that ordinary citizens are not increasing their spending fast enough, the government can cope.
""If the alternative is unemployment, it is better to employ people to do something, even if it is not very value-adding.
""Lots of people are still living in old housing units left over from the 1990s, so it would be worthwhile employing people to build replacements for those. Unfortunately, a lot of labour instead gets wasted on building tasteless villas for the super-wealthy.
""China's economy is unfair and inefficient, but it's not unstable.""

The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report.
The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military.
Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September.
On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat.
""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying.
How China became the US election bogeyman
Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"".
""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.""
While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies.
""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says.
""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.""
The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement.
Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations.
""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday.
On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS.
""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said.
Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"".
China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms.
""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.
""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.""
Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987.
As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced.
There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied.
Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel.
Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China.
Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September.
ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal.
This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic.
Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms.
Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon.
It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years.
The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority.

<article>
Labour MP Yvette Cooper said it was not ""appropriate"" or ""statesmanlike"" for him to use such language about a ""complex and sensitive"" issue.
Shadow minister Kate Green said it was ""offensive, hurtful... and divisive"".
Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp ""they could all come to Britain"".
At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as ""disgraceful"".
Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant.
But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions.
""We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff,"" said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the ""bedroom tax"" and a High Court ruling that it is ""discriminatory"". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.
The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was ""not part of Saudi-led operations"" in Yemen.
But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comment.
Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.
The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.
Mr Cameron replied: ""The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.
""Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.
""They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.
""They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.
""The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers.""
Several Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comments on Twitter, describing them as ""shameful"" and ""inflammatory"" and the PM as ""odious"".
A Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase ""demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep"".
Yvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use ""much more statesmanship-like"" language on such a ""complex and sensitive"" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.
She got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order
She asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to ""withdraw"" the comment.
Mr Bercow told Ms Cooper: ""You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.
""I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously.""
He ruled that it was not ""disorderly"" or ""un-Parliamentary"" but added ""people will make their own assessments of this matter"".
The prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent Â£1.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would ""open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais"".
Asked if he considered the phrase ""bunch of migrants"" to be pejorative the spokesman said ""the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right"".
Mr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the ""bunch of migrants"" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.
But this was dismissed as ""silly and playing cheap politics"" by small business minister Anna Soubry
She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the ""language of ordinary people"", adding ""we all use slang"" in the heat of the moment.
David Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.
Mr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a ""major success"" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a ""step forward"", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it ""derisory"".
Mr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was ""0%"".
Mr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.
""Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st,"" he said.
""They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.
""Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?""'
Mr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.
Firstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a ""victory"" and a ""major success"". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.
Secondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.
Thirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.
HMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.
But few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.
Mr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a ""striking"" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.
Downing Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.
""It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come,"" Mr Cameron said.
""It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity.""
The SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.
He called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).
Mr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at Â£155 a week would end discrimination because ""so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension"".
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.
""The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe,"" he said.
He urged Mr Cameron to ""welcome in and provide a home"" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.
In response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been ""more generous"" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.

The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one.
Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem.
They broke a rule saying: ""The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.""
Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision.
The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track.
Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a ""critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal"".
Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem.
But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear.
Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: ""Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.""
Rosberg then asked: ""What does that mean, I have to shift through it?
Engineer: ""Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.""
Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance.
Horner said: ""The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules.
""The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running.
""It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing.
""The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question.""
Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap.
Wolff said: ""We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time.""
However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

Caretaker manager Paul Warne has been in charge of the Millers since Kenny Jackett's departure on 28 November.
""Paul Warne, Matt Hamshaw and John Breckin will remain in control of the first team throughout the Christmas period,"" said a club statement.
""The club will continue to work towards a position where we can announce a more permanent solution in early January.""
Rotherham, who are bottom of the table and have lost 13 of their past 15 matches, host 23rd-placed Wigan on Boxing Day and 21st-placed Burton three days later.
The statement added: ""Paul Warne and his staff will work closely with our new head of recruitment Jamie Johnson to indentify, and move for, targets ahead of the upcoming January transfer window.""
Warne has said that he does not want the job on a full-time basis.
Former Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Jackett was in charge of the Millers for 39 days before offering his resignation.
Rotherham have had five permanent managers and three caretakers since the start of last season, with Neil Redfearn, Neil Warnock, Alan Stubbs and Jackett all having spells in the job following Steve Evans' departure in September 2015.
Eric Black was placed in temporary charge after Evans left, while Nicky Eaden was appointed caretaker-manager when Redfearn was sacked in February - although Warnock was appointed before the former Birmingham and Wigan defender had the chance to lead the team in a game.

Owen Creaney, from Lurgan, was found dead on 5 July 2014.
Shauneen Boyle, 25, and Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, are jointly charged with his murder.
A friend of Ms Boyle's said she received a text on Friday 4 July which said Ms Boyle was ""in trouble"".
Mairead McGuigan told the jury at Belfast Crown Court that she later phoned Ms Boyle.
""She said she got into a fight with Owen, she had went mad, she had beat a fella up after getting into an argument and she jumped on his stomach and his head. She might have said that he was in a bad way,"" she said.
""She said there was blood all over his face. She said his face was busted open.''
Ms McGuigan said Ms Boyle phoned her about 21:00 and asked her to call round to Mr Hughes's house after work.
""She asked me to bring round my hoover and my carpet cleaner as she said there was a stain on the white carpet,'' she said
The witness said she called to Mr Hughes's house at Moyraverty Court, Craigavon, about 21:35 and told a prosecution barrister that she took a seat on the sofa in the living next to Ms Boyle while Mr Hughes remained standing in front of them.
""They were drinking. Shauneen said: 'I got into a fight with Owen Creaney over my dad',"" she Ms McGuigan said.
""Stephen said nothing. I asked him why he didn't break it up. He said he was afraid and said he had got his blinds broken.""
She told the court she was about to leave when she heard noises coming from upstairs and realised Mr Creaney was up there.
Ms Boyle told her he had been sleeping for 28 hours and was drunk after consuming alcohol.
Ms McGuigan followed the pair upstairs and saw Mr Creaney lying on a sofa.
""He was making funny breathing noises, like heavy breathing. Shauneen said he was sleeping. He was like bruised with yellow bruising. There was foam coming out of his mouth,"" she said.
""I told them to get the police, that this man has a broken rib. Shauneen said Stephen was afraid of the police coming to the house. I said he definitely has a broken rib and she said Owen had drank a litre of vodka and was lying sleeping.''
She told the court that the pair told her they had showered Mr Creaney following the fight to ""to try and bring him round"" and had changed him and washed his clothes.'
Ms McGuigan left the property and told a male friend what had happened.
She said she was in contact with Ms Boyle the following morning.
Ms McGuigan said she asked Ms Boyle about Mr Creaney, to which she replied: ""He is dead.'' I said: 'Get that man to the hospital now.''
""Shauneen said: 'It's too late. There is nothing more we can do for him'. But I don't think she was telling the truth.''
She said that during the phone call, she overheard a conversation between the pair talking about an ""empty wheelie bin"".
Ms Boyle's lawyer asked Ms McGuigan if she remembered getting a text on the Saturday morning in which his client had denied the murder.  She said she did not.
Both Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park, Banbridge, and Mr Hughes, whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry deny the charges.

These aren't real products, of course, but an art project poking fun at Asia's obsession with beauty and its propensity for conspicuous consumption.
The display was created by the inaugural cohort of Singapore-based graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, which set up its first overseas campus here in 2011.
The Scottish arts institution is looking to expand its course offerings over the next few years and aims to help develop the city-state's creative scene.
""We hope that we can use this platform and build relationships with other parts of the region using it as a hub,"" said its director, Tom Inns.
""To be an international art schools you've got to understand how the world works in terms of regions and different thinking and different cultures.
""It is only by being there that you can only really begin to understand that. You can't understand that from a distance.""
But if the experience of the last foreign creative arts school to open up in Singapore is anything to go by, there may be some challenges ahead.
This summer, the editing labs and sound engineering stations at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in Asia will fall silent for good.
The campus, set upon three-acres of prime property in central Singapore, is closing less than 10 years after opening due to millions of dollars of debts.
NYU still operates two degree-granting, liberal arts research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.
""Despite its significant creative success, the Tisch Asia campus failed to become financially sustainable,"" says a university statement.
John Beckman, vice president for public affairs at New York University said that reflecting back, they had ""learned a number of lessons"" from their experience.
""Academically and artistically, the Tisch Asia campus was a tremendous success,"" he said. ""But academic excellence is also expensive"".
""We were too optimistic about prospective enrolments both internationally and locally, the latter of which has been pivotal to many global academic initiatives.
""We operate on the principle that we will not direct money from the campus in New York to sustain global operations, we should have factored in a greater degree of support needed beyond tuition, especially in the critical start-up years.""
Mr Beckman added that Tisch Asia ""as a relatively small, independent graduate arts conservatory, was an ambitious enterprise"".
""The general lesson we learned was that it would have been better to have developed such a significant project as part of - and not separate from - our university-wide global efforts.""
The closure was not just a high-profile and expensive failure for the school, but for the Singapore government, which had invited them to set up here in 2007.
However, Tisch Asia is not alone.
In recent years, Australia's University of New South Wales, the University of Las Vegas Nevada and Warwick University have all exited, mostly due to financial reasons.
Singapore used to publicise its aim of becoming a global education hub, saying it hoped the sector would ultimately contribute up to 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
The Economic Development Board (EDB), which seeks to bring investments to Singapore, launched the ""Global Schoolhouse"" project in 2002.
The scheme saw it offer millions of dollars in grants and subsidies to attract top names here. In many ways, it has been quite a success.
French business school INSEAD has been operating its satellite campus. American Ivy League university Yale also launched here, despite some controversy.
But following the high-profile failure of Tisch Asia and other foreign universities, it seems the government has changed its tune about attracting more entrants.
Alvin Tan, the EDB's assistant managing director of corporate development, says that in recent years the local higher education provision has increased in ""diversity and quality"" and he talks of any future incoming institutions as being a ""complement"" to strong local options.
A university's future in Singapore doesn't only come down to financial considerations, however.
The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business decided to relocate its campus from Singapore to Hong Kong in order to be situated closer to the China market.
William Kooser, the associate dean of global outreach at the University of Chicago said their lease in Singapore was expiring this year and that their strategy came up for review.
""There are a couple of things that schools need to understand before they decide to go overseas,"" said Mr Kooser.
""One is that it's not easy. It is not simply a matter of duplicating what you do in the United States and plopping it into another city.
""Two, you need to understand what it is you are trying to get out of the programme. Is it simply trying to create revenue? Or is it something beyond that?
""If it is simply to create revenue, if you don't to meet your revenue targets, it's easy to pull out. If you are trying to achieve something else you are typically in it for the longer haul.""
Singapore is regularly cited for its high quality of life, political stability, low-tax environment and ease of doing business.
However, the city-state's rising cost of living has led to major issues for both foreign universities and students.
It is the most expensive country in the world, according to an annual survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Singapore's booming property prices and strong currency has also translated into high rent and tuition fees.
Then there is the question of getting a job after graduation.
Singapore's labour market has tightened over the last few years, making it harder for foreigners to get job here.
One year after the Glasgow School of Art's first graduation ceremony, another group of students are preparing their final year projects.
It is a sweltering hot day and they are on campus despite it being a school holiday, listening to pop music while painting large wooden panels. Their enthusiasm is clear.
But like so many students at Tisch, the future of their campus may ultimately come down to dollars and cents.

Baroness Morgan said Labour is in a serious situation if it cannot reconnect with working class communities.
She said there ""probably was an element"" of Labour's Remain campaign starting too late.
""A lot of us were exhausted"", she told BBC Radio Wales.
Senior Welsh Labour sources have privately said they were wary of talking about Brexit before the assembly election in case it drove Eurosceptic supporters towards UKIP.
Plaid leader no longer ruling out coalition with Labour
AMs to have say on Brexit deal, says Welsh Tory leader
Corbyn's Labour set for heavy losses, says Stephen Kinnock
Asked if Labour's Remain campaign started too late, she told the Eye on Wales programme: ""I think there probably was an element of that.
""And don't forget in Wales we had the assembly elections where people were not talking about the European Union. We were focused absolutely on those assembly elections.""
She added: ""I think it was a mistake not to be talking about the European referendum in those assembly elections.""
Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% for Brexit. Only five counting areas voted to Remain.
The strongest Leave votes were in Torfaen (60%) and Blaenau Gwent (62%) - two traditional Labour strongholds in the south Wales valleys.
The Welsh government has a programme to ""re-energise"" communities that voted to Leave, much of which would have been funded by EU money, Baroness Morgan said.
""The question for us now is how on Earth do we reorganise the economy without that European funding?"" she asked.
""Unless we find a way to reconnect with that working class element within our communities then I think the Labour party is in a serious situation in future"".
Labour won 29 seats at May's assembly election - a better result than many expected - but lost 7.6% of its share of the vote on the constituency ballot.
Earlier, on BBC Sunday Politics Wales, Baroness Morgan said Carwyn Jones was ""absolutely, without question"" the right man to lead Welsh Labour.

<article>
The 41-year-old has recorded 696 home runs, putting him fourth on the Major League Baseball all-time list.
He was given a 162-game ban for doping in January 2014, meaning he missed the entire 2014 season.
Rodriguez's final game will be at Yankee Stadium against the Tampa Bay Rays and he will then take on an advisor role at the club.
He helped the Yankees win the World Series in 2009 and was voted the American League's Most Valuable Player in 2003, 2005 and 2007.
""This is a tough day. I love this game and I love this team and today I am saying goodbye to both,"" Rodriguez said.
""This is also a proud day. I was 18 when I broke into the big leagues and I never thought I would play for 22 years.
""No player ends their career the way they want to, we all want to keep playing forever but it doesn't work that way. Accepting the end gracefully is part of being a professional athlete.
""I want to thank the fans for letting me play the game I love.""
